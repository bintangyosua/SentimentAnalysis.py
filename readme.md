# Sentiment Analysis in Twitter Using TextBlob

This code written with Python, Tweepy, Re, and TextBlob. For the maximum optimization, we just use english because the other language is not yet optimized like english

You need to use Jupyter Notebook to run this code.
There is `hasilSearch = api.search_tweets(q="obama", lang="en", count=100)`. You just need to change the q parameter to a word what you want.
